# Follow up questions

## If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? Would you implement anything differently?
I think there is still a lot of potential on webpage design. It can looks much better with more css attribute.

Secondly, there is several broken links for the imageurl. If it is possible, I will replace these url will vaild url.

Thirdly, in my idea, the best way to show these information on the webpage should be: We display several images without any text. If user move their cursor on the image, the image should display some basic information like community name and avg price. Besides, user can also click the image to scan the detail of the community(list all the homes in the community). This one should be a formal business webpage.
